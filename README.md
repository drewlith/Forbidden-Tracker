Install: Download the Forbidden Tracker.zip file and then use a program like 7-Zip to unzip the contents to a location of your choice. Then run the Forbidden-Tracker.exe file.

Controls: Left click on a glyph to increase the associate counter, right click to decrease it. Duel rank will be calculated automatically. POW mode will make all counts zero after a rank reset. TEC mode will set cards used to 37, face downs to 1, and turns passed to 9 automatically after a rank reset.

Hope you enjoy and let me know if you'd like to see any new features or find any bugs! I am @drewlith on social media drewlith#0001 on Discord.
